# Sustainable Urban Systems
 
The Sustainable Urban Systems emphasis merges traditional data analytics with complex systems analysis to better inform decisions around the wicked problems of urban development like urban land use, mobility, sustainability and hazard analysis.

An [Opportunity to Purchase Act](https://www.cityofepa.org/housing/page/east-palo-alto-opportunity-purchase-act-epa-opa 0#:~:text=An%20Opportunity%20to%20Purchase%20Act,owner%20is%20ready%20to%20sell.) ("OPA") policy gives tenants, qualified nonprofits, or jurisdictions the first opportunity to purchase a residential property or assign their right to purchase to another entity when the owner is ready to sell. The City of East Palo Alto (EPA) has been considering an OPA policy, which has aroused heated discussion among stakeholders. 
The report tried to explore quantitatively from the perspective of policy necessity. More specifically, two questions will be answered: 
 * whether the housing burden is a relatively severe challenge for most residuals in EPA and 
 * whether single-family dwellings should be included in the policy.

## [Hazard Analysis](https://j-i-n-p-u.github.io/Sustainable-Urban-System/HTML/Hazard_Analysis.html)

<br />
For a given discrete hazard event, whether it happened in the past or is predicted to happen in the future,  we could geospatially visualize the boundary of the hazard. The vulnerability of each point in the boundary can be quantified based on its physical meaning. The project developed a hazard risk analysis to estimate the vehicle damages caused by flooding in Menlo Park City.
